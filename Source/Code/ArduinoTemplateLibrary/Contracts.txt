This file documents the standard code contracts that are expected of classes used as a BaseT template parameter.

Conventions
- Lower case 'get' and 'set' prefix indicate an object property.
- The template parameter that is used as a (public) base class is always called 'BaseT'.



IO.Stream
A stream is the base interface for both the InputStream and OutputStream interface.

unsigned int getLength();
Returns the number of bytes that are available in the stream.



IO.InputStream
A stream that is filled by some source (device) and can be read by the software.

int Read();
Reads one 'byte' from the stream and returns is as an Integer. A return value of -1 means no more data is available or an error has occurred.



IO.OutputStream
A stream that is filled by software and is drained by some destination (device).

bool Write(int data);
Writes one 'byte' to the stream. Returns true when successful or false if not.

void Flush();
Writes all the bytes buffered in the stream towards the output device.



IO.Hardware.DigitalInput
An hardware input that has a logical value.

bool Read();
Returns true when a new/different value was read.

bool getValue();
Returns the current value (last read).




Midi.MidiReader
A class that implements the Midi protocol for reading Midi messages.

void OnMessage(MidiMessage*);
Is called when a complete midi message was read.

void OnRealTime(Midi::MessageTypes);
Is called when a realtime message is received.

void OnSysEx(BaseT*);
Is called when a System Exclusive message of variable length is received (not implemented yet!).
