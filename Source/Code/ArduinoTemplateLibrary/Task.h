 *  The Task implementation is based on macros forming a switch statement. 
 *  It is possible to jump in and out of switch-cases and together
 *  with a _task variable a Task can be 'resumed' at the correct
 *  position.
 *  Keep the logic inside the Task method simple for it can cause compile errors.
 *  Calling functions is no problem.
 *
 *  This code was taken from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj553509.aspx
 *  It seems a lightweight way to implement cooperative multitasking.
 *  See Also TimeoutTask for an example.
 *  You MUST have an "uint16_t _task" (private) variable to store the task state (FSM).
